/*
Create a list, seqList, of N empty sequences, where each sequence is indexed from 0 to N â€“ 1. The elements within each of the N sequences also use 0-indexing.
Create an integer, lastAnswer, and initialize it to 0.

The 2 types of queries that can be performed on your list of sequences (seqList) are described below:
  Query: 1 x y
    Find the sequence, seq, at index ((x XOR lastAnswer)) % N) in seqList.
    Append integer y to sequence seq.
  Query: 2 x y
    Find the sequence, seq, at index ((x XOR lastAnswer)) % N) in seqList.
    Find the value of element y % size in seq (where size is the size of seq) and assign it to lastAnswer.
    Print the new value of lastAnswer on a new line

Task
  Given N, Q, and Q queries, execute each query.
  Note: bitwise XOR operation, which corresponds to the ^ operator in most languages. Learn more about it on Wikipedia.

Input Format
  The first line contains two space-separated integers, N (the number of sequences) and Q (the number of queries), respectively.
  Each of the Q subsequent lines contains a query in the format defined above.

Constraints
  1 <= N, Q <= 1010
  0 <= x <= 109
  0 <= y <= 109
  It is guaranteed that query type 2 will never query an empty sequence or index.

Output Format
  For each type 2 query, print the updated value of lastAnswer on a new line.

Sample Input
  2 5
  1 0 5
  1 1 7
  1 0 3
  2 1 0
  2 1 1
Sample Output
  7
  3

Explanation
Initial Values:
  N = 2
  lastAnswer = 0
  S0 = []
  S1 = []

Query 0: Append 5 to sequence ((0 XOR 0) % 2) = 0
  lastAnswer = 0
  S0 = [5]
  S1 = []

Query 1: Append 7 to sequence ((1 XOR 0) % 2) = 1
  S0 = [5]
  S1 = [7]

Query 2: Append 3 to sequence ((0 XOR 0) % 2) = 0
  lastAnswer = 0
  S0 = [5,3]
  S1 = [7]

Query 3: Assign the value at index 0 of sequence ((1 XOR 0) % 2) = 1 to lastAnswer, print lastAnswer
  lastAnswer = 7
  S0 = [5,3]
  S1 = [7]
  result = [7]

Query 4: Assign the value at index 1 of sequence ((1 XOR 7) % 2) = 0 to lastAnswer, print lastAnswer
  lastAnswer = 3
  S0 = [5,3]
  S1 = [7]
  result = [7, 3]
